# Handwritten-digit-recognization-using-KNN-classifier
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

* To read about the MINST handwritten dataset go to [Minst dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
* The data is already downloaded into two folder's named : 
    1. Training data<br>
        1.1 train-images.idx3-ubyte - It contains training data of 60,000 handwritten images.<br>
        1.2 train-labels.idx1-ubyte - It contains the label of the digit corresponding to the features.
    2. Test data<br>
        2.1 t10k-images.idx3-ubyte - It contains testing data of 10,000 handwritten images.<br>
        2.2 t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte - It contains the label of the digit corresponding to the features of test data.
